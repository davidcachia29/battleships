Turn based sequence for battleships
-----------------------------------

Player 1 Places ships...game is stopped
Player 2 Place ships...game is stopped

Once both players have placed the ships, the game can start

player1placed (boolean)
player2placed (boolean)

At this point we need to save the positions of the ships on firebase*

1. We need a coroutine CONSTANTLY checking the database to see if 
player 1 AND player 2 have all placed their ships.

We also need to display who has placed all of his ships.

after both have been placed, the game can start

2. We need to (randomly) select which player starts

3. We need to give Player X some time to shoot (he can shoot one shot)

4. Player X can hit, in which case he gets another shot, or he doesn't, in which case it's the other player's turn.

5. Other player shoots and executes 4.

6. All the ships for one player are sunk.  Player loses.
